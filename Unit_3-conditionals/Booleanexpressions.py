#boolean expreeions
# kinda like a mathematical formula
#14 + 10 = 24        algebra uses arethmatic operators
# can only evaluate to true and false
# 5 > 10 = False boolean algebra uses  comparison operators
# > < >= == !=
print(5 > 10) #boolean algebra

print(5 == 5)   # == asks for what tequal to it

x = 5      #this is set x equal to s tell it what to be
print(x == 5) # Get x equals 5, asks a questions

#this is the perfect test question
# what is the diff between = and == ?

print(4 >= 2)     #true
print(1993 == 1993)    #true
print( -90 < -99)     #false
print(10 != 10)       #false, "not"

#boolean expressions quiz!
